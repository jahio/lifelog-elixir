# TODO List

Here's the stuff I need to get done in the short term:

[ ] Simple mix command to create new events in the DB, something like:

    mix log -ns "DogLog" -l "Medication" --notes "clomicalm 20mg"

[ ] Simple data-entry web front-end
[ ] Mix task to dump structure **and** data from psql to file as a sqldump
[ ] Automation of some kind (`crontab -e` perhaps?) for backing up that sqldump
